Skincare-Market-Formulation-Insights
Project Overview:
Skincare-Market-Formulation-Insights is a full-stack data analysis and visualization project designed to collect, process, and present global skincare usage data. The project utilizes a web scraping pipeline to gather raw data, a backend API to serve processed data, and a dynamic frontend dashboard to visualize key trends.

Problem: The worldwide skincare market is vast and complex, making it difficult to analyze trends.
Solution: I developed a full-stack web platform to address this by analyzing and visualizing worldwide skincare market data.

Key Contributions:

Data Collection: I used Python (Scrapy) to build a web crawler that efficiently collected extensive datasets from multiple online sources, storing the raw data in a PostgreSQL database.

API Development: I designed and implemented a RESTful API using Django REST Framework to serve processed and filtered data efficiently to the frontend.

Data Visualization: I used React.js and Chart.js to create interactive and responsive charts that visually represent skincare trends by continent, providing a clear, user-friendly interface for analysis.

Deployment & CI/CD: I containerized the entire application using Docker and deployed it on AWS. To ensure a streamlined workflow, I configured GitHub Actions for automated continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), enabling automatic updates.

Quality Assurance: To guarantee application reliability, I implemented a robust testing strategy, including unit and integration tests using PyTest for the backend and Jest for the frontend.

Tech Stack: Python, Django, Scrapy, PostgreSQL, React.js, Chart.js, Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions, PyTest, Jest, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
