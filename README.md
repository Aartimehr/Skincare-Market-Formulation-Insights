Skincare-Market-Formulation-Insights
Project Overview:
Skincare-Market-Formulation-Insights is a full-stack data analysis and visualization project designed to collect, process, and present global skincare usage data. The project utilizes a web scraping pipeline to gather raw data, a backend API to serve processed data, and a dynamic frontend dashboard to visualize key trends.

Features
1. Automated Data Collection:

A robust web scraping pipeline, built with Scrapy, that navigates multiple online sources to collect raw data on skincare usage.

2. Data Processing & Storage:

Raw data is cleaned and processed using Python and the Pandas library.

The structured data is then stored in a backend database, ready for use by the API.

3. Backend API:

A RESTful API is developed to serve the cleaned and processed data.

The API endpoints provide easy access to the data, enabling the frontend dashboard to fetch and render information efficiently.

4. Interactive Frontend Dashboard:

A user-friendly dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The dashboard uses data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to display interactive charts that highlight continental trends in skincare practices .
Tech Stack
Backend & Data Engineering:

Python: The core language for the entire pipeline.

Scrapy: For building the web scraping spider.

Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

SQL: For database interaction and querying.

Frontend & Visualization:

HTML: For the structure of the dashboard.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript: For frontend logic and API communication.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used to generate static chart visualizations on the server-side, which are then served to the frontend.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

pip (Python package installer)

A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/skinlytics.git
cd skinlytics

Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username.

2. Set up a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the requirements.txt file (you will need to create this file yourself with the project dependencies):

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Web Scraper
The Scrapy spider will crawl the web and store the data in your database.

# Example command to run your spider (you will need to replace `your_spider_name`)
scrapy crawl your_spider_name

5. Start the Backend Server
Once the data is in the database, you can start the API to serve it.

6. Open the Frontend
With the server running, simply open the index.html file in your browser to view the live dashboard.
